# Contact Form Setup Guide

## ✅ No Backend Required!

Your contact form is now set up to work **without deploying a backend server**. Here's how it works:

## 🔧 How It Works

The contact form uses **FormSubmit.co**, a free service that sends form submissions directly to your email.

### Current Setup:
- **Email**: envionixlabs@gmail.com
- **Phone Numbers**: 
  - +91 7002071035
  - +91 8011666517

## 📧 First-Time Setup (Important!)

### Step 1: Activate Your Email
When you first deploy your website and someone submits the contact form:

1. **FormSubmit.co will send a confirmation email** to `envionixlabs@gmail.com`
2. **You MUST click the confirmation link** in that email
3. After confirmation, all future submissions will be sent directly to your inbox

### Step 2: Deploy Your Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Then deploy the `frontend/dist` folder to any hosting service:
- **Vercel** (Recommended)
- **Netlify**
- **GitHub Pages**
- **Firebase Hosting**

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy with Vercel (Easiest)
```bash
npm install -g vercel
cd frontend
vercel
```

### Option 2: Deploy with Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. Drag and drop your `frontend/dist` folder
3. Done!

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Select the branch and `/frontend/dist` folder
4. Your site will be live!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting
